# Code Your Career

This webpage is a guide to increasing one's programming knowledge and contains general tips and resources that have been gathered from hours of searching and watching videos which will be useful for anyone looking to get into coding or tech in general. As more information/resources are learned and gathered, the moderators will continue update the webpage to be even more helpful. Note that while certificates can be tempting to pay for, the more important aspects of these courses are the skills you derive from them so keep that in mind and approach these courses.

## General Tips:

### Jobs
- Do not wait till your last year to start job hunting. Use your time now to study up on local and international companies so that you have a proper idea of what you will want to be once you're done with your degree.
- Start now to understand what recruiters want and what you should build your resume's around.
- In technical interviews, the recruiters want to see how you tackle the problem and not your solution itself as these recruiters mostly know the answer already so your focus should be on asking as many questions as you can no matter how insignificant as this shows the interviewer that you want to make sure your code will be flawless and that you are actually thinking about every possible step of your code. Then when actually solving the problem, try writing pseudocode and explain your thought process to the interviewer to show them that you know what you are talking about and that you can clearly explain your code.
- Use LinkedIn to find job requirements for the fields you want to go into by searching your job in the "search" box and checking the most popular offerings. However, remember	while LinkedIn has many jobs, there are jobs that will have ridiculous requirements like an entry level job asking you for 10 years of experience in one skill or asking you to do 10 job's work disguised as one like a company wanting a web developer wanting you to also do the graphics, animation, interface design, etc... Things which are generally out of your jobs scope.)

### Knowledge & Skill

- It is better to be an expert in a select few languages than to shallowly know many languages.
- Attend as many events as you can in your universities such as career fairs, hackathons, club events and more to make connections and look for opportunities. A bonus if you participate as this can help you learn things practically.
- Try participating in hackathons and even if you don't know much as to what to do, attend it just to know how it is and to understand how it works as hackathons are more than just coding. They're about making a product and marketing it to the judges. Winning is not what matters, its participating and gaining insightful knowledge that really matters.
- One way you can practice your knowledge of your projects is by explaining your complex projects and such to a friend with no coding knowledge. If you can explain them how your code works then you can be assured your code will work properly too.
- **KEEP. MAKING. PROJECTS.** : this can be anything no matter how simple or how complex like a simple calculator, a to-do list maker, a game solving AI, etc. Projects are the best way to show your abilities to anyone that glances at your resume/portfolio so make sure you have a lot of them. However, only once you have a lot of projects then pick and choose the best ones to showcase your talents.
