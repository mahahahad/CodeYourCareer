### General Tips:

- Don't wait till your last year to start using job hunting tricks, start now to understand what recruiters want and what you should build your resume's around
- Attend any events and stuff in your unis to make connections and look for opportunities
- Try participating in hackathons and even if u don't know much as to what to do, attend it just to know how it is and to understand how it works
- Learn how to explain your thought process when doing projects as you're going to have to do the same during job interviews. in job interviews, they want to see how u tackle the problem so u should ask questions no matter how small about the problem and explain your thought process as this gives the recruiter the idea that you are a capable teacher and can ask questions without the fear of embarrassment
- KEEP MAKING PROJECTS: this can be anything no matter how simple or how complex like a calculator, to do list etc...
- When using LinkedIn to find job requirements 

	Remember: 
	while LinkedIn has many jobs, there are jobs that ask you to do 10 job's work.
	(like a company wanting a web developer could ask you to also do the graphics, 
	animation, interface design, etc... Things which are generally out of your jobs scope)
